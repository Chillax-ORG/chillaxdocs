### 1. How to change the background/background image of CHILLAX?

The steps are first `settings`, then go to the `VENCORD` Section and then `Themes`.
Finally, click `Edit Quick CSS` which should open integrated
[Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) (*It's already there no need
for installation as this is part of the Vencord itself*) code editor.
Now using this Editor, you can easily edit css with hot reloading.
See the below-attached screenshots:

3. <img src="monaco_editor.png" alt="whatever" border-effect="rounded"/>

Now to go to line number `46` (*at the time of writing, the line number
is 46 which in a later version might change*) or where the variable `--wallpaper`
defined and change the url that is within the single quote `''`
to the wallpaper/gif **url** that you want to set.

See the below screenshots:

Now your favourite background image/gif should be applied.
