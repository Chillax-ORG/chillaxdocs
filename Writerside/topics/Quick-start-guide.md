While not strictly necessary, the following things are highly recommended.

* Turn on hardware acceleration if it's not already enabled by default in the Discord settings section.
    *  Steps are `Settings` > `Advanced` > `Hardware Acceleration`
* Install a LaTeX distribution like MiKTeX or TeX Live, following their installation instructions, or the [TeXiFy installation guide](Installation-guide.md).
